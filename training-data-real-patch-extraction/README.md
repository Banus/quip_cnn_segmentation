# Extracting real training data

This code extracts 400x400 training patches from a manually labeled nuclei segmentation dataset (https://monuseg.grand-challenge.org/Data/).  
The extracted patches should saved under segmentation-of-nuclei/image_sup, and segmentation-of-nuclei/mask_sup.

1. Download the training set from https://monuseg.grand-challenge.org/Data  
2. unzip and move the "MoNuSeg Training Data" folder to the same path as extract_patches.py
